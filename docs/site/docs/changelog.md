# Changelog & Stability

Current status: early stage. Major features are subject to change; core syntax is stabilizing.

Planned to track here:
- Language changes (syntax, semantics)
- Stdlib additions/removals
- Runtime/VM changes
- CLI flags and breaking changes

For now, see commit history and release notes in the repository.
